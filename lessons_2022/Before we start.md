# Before we start

## Why py?
* Efficient (loop friendly)
* Versatile (C, but can integrate C#, .net, JS, ObjectiveC etc.)
* Libraries/packages by domain experts(e.g. scipy)
* Readable 
* Fun Monty python references

## R vs python
* coursera [Python or R for Data Analysis: Which Should I Learn?](https://www.coursera.org/articles/python-or-r-for-data-analysis)
* datacamp [Choosing Python or R for Data Analysis? An Infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis)
* rstudio [R vs. Python: What’s the best language for Data Science?](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/12/17/r-vs-python-what-s-the-best-for-language-for-data-science/)
* Running python in [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/) (R notebooks, Quarto, reticulate)
* Run either in jupyter with the proper kernal

## [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python)

## Tools
Text editor – where your script is written
* IDLE (in python instal)
* Notepad
* Notepad++
* Visual Studio
* Rstudio
Development environment (IDE) – where code is run (Console)
* Command line
* Spyder (similar to R studio/matlab, comes with annaconda)
* PyCharm (good for web dev, Git, support for JS, HTML/CSS etc.)
* Jupyter notebooks (cloud- based, great for instruction and web based)
* Rodeo (very similar look/feel to Rstudio)

## environments
![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)

Great in concept - allow you to switch between versions and packages
* Anaconda distribution (comes with many scientific packages)
* Conda environment management (part of anaconda & ArcGIS Pro)
* Virtual environments
