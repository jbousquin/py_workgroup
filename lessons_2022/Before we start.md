# Before we start

## Why py?
* Efficient (loop friendly)
* Versatile (C, but can integrate C#, .net, JS, ObjectiveC etc.)
* Libraries/packages by domain experts (e.g. scipy)
* Readable 
* Fun Monty python references

## R vs python
* coursera [Python or R for Data Analysis: Which Should I Learn?](https://www.coursera.org/articles/python-or-r-for-data-analysis)
* datacamp [Choosing Python or R for Data Analysis? An Infographic](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis)
* rstudio [R vs. Python: What’s the best language for Data Science?](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/12/17/r-vs-python-what-s-the-best-for-language-for-data-science/)
* Running python in [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/) (R notebooks, Quarto, reticulate)
* Run either in jupyter with the proper kernal

## [Zen of Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python)

## Tools
Text editor – where your script is written
* IDLE (in python install)
* Notepad
* Notepad++

Console - where code is run

* IDLE Shell
* Command line

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) – combines these plus more

* Visual Studio (multi-language)
* Rstudio (R, some Python)
* Spyder (similar to R studio/matlab)
* PyCharm (good for web dev, Git, support for JS, HTML/CSS etc.)
* Jupyter notebooks (cloud-based, great for instruction and web)

For further info - see reccent lightning talks on IDEs (EPA Internal)

## environments
![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment.png)

Great in concept - allow you to switch between versions and packages
* [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (comes with many scientific packages)
* Conda environment management (part of anaconda & ArcGIS Pro)
* Virtual environments (usually set up through pip install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/))
