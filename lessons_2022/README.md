## Overview

For 2022 I decided to update materials for excercises based on [datacarpentry's Ecology Curriculum](https://github.com/datacarpentry/python-ecology-lesson/). As a result these are going to be a combination of markdown files and ipython notebooks (shared on [geoplatform](https://epa.maps.arcgis.com/home/index.html)). Felt like an improvement over pptx downloads, welcome feedback as we go.

I will try to post recordings to the network drive (L:\Public\jbousqui\Resources\Python)
