# py_workgroup
This repository contains materials for the workgroup to use while learning python.

The purpose of this group is to work together to learn new skills, languages, data science practices, etc. as they relate to our research in environmental science. The primary focus will be the use of python, with excercises focused on accessing data from the web and manipulating spatial data in arcGIS desktop using arcpy. However, topics are not limited to these and you're encouraged to bring ideas and tools from other topics or languages.

# GitHub and this repository
This repository is public and thus anyone can access the files; however, only collaborators on the repository can add or edit files. I encourage everyone to sign up for a GitHub account, they are free and you will be able to take advantage of our issues for discussions and you can be added as a collaborator on the repository.

# Repository Structure
To keep things neat and tiddy we will impose some structures and best practices. These should resemble typical practices where possible (e.g. README) so that if you move to repositories maintained by other, at least something should look familiar.


# File naming conventions
So that it is easier for us to find materials and keep things looking orderly, we will follow these rules for naming files in the notes and meetings sections:

1. Only use lower case (with the exception of the files listed above).
2. No spaces are allowed in file names.
3. Start out the name with something descriptive followed by the date with year, month, day separated by underscore.
4. Use conventions for file extensions (e.g. .md for markdown, .R for R script, .py for python etc.).

For example, copy_feature_example_2018_01_11.py would be a good file name.
