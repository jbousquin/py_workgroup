# Imitating a manual workflow
Let's say we wanted to get a shapefile for Santa Rosa county where the Gulf Breeze lab is. Doing this manually:
  1. Google "santa rosa county census shapefile" and follow the first [hit](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2019-county-santa-rosa-county-fl-address-range-feature-county-based)
  2. Scroll down on the site to find the first download button and copy it's link address. It should be:
https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/ADDRFEAT/tl_2019_12113_addrfeat.zip
  
Doing this in python using [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html):
  
    import urllib
    
    
    # Set a variable to the link
    url = "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/ADDRFEAT/tl_2019_12113_addrfeat.zip"
    
    filename = r"C:\Users\<user name>\Desktop\SantaRosaCounty.zip"  # Save As filename
    
    # python 2
    urllib.urlretrieve(url, filename)
    # python 3 it has been nested in request
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)
    
# Scaling the workflow
All the county file names are based on FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) codes. For our example: 12 = Florida, 113 = Santa Rosa ([list](https://www.census.gov/prod/techdoc/cbp/cbp95/st-cnty.pdf))
We can create a quick function to download each county from a list:
  
    import urllib
    
    
    def downloadCounty(fip):
      url = "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/ADDRFEAT/tl_2019_{}_addrfeat.zip".format(fip)
      filename = r"C:\Users\<user name>\Desktop\{}.zip".format(fip)
      urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)
      
    
    fip_list = ['12113', '12033', '01003',]
    for fip in fip_list:
      downloadCounty(fip)
  
Instead using [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
  
    import requests
    
    response = requests.get(url)
    zip = response.content  # The download file can then be altered in memory or written to filename
    
# Data from an API
Now that we have our 3 shapefiles the next step might be to get data for those counties. Many datasets are available through an Application Programing Interface (API).
Census makes many of their [datasets available](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html) through a REST API

We'll work through an example where we Get information via an API but many are set up to allow you to Post new data or alter existing data. 

2018 5-year ACS
https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html

Each dataset has a brief description as well as:
 - API Call - to use as the base url
 - Supported variables and geographies
 - Examples

Working from the example:
https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5?get=NAME,group(B01001)&for=us:1
Name and group(B01001) are the variables (sex by age) and us:1 is the geography

We can look at other variables to choose from [json](https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5/variables.json). Then substitute those into the url. For example for 'B01001_001' Total:
https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B01001_001&for=us:1

We can change the geography in a similar way, replacing the entire US with FL:
https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B01001_001E&for=state:12

For a county within a state:
https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B01001_001E&for=county:033&in=state:12

For all counties in a state:
https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B01001_001E&for=county:*&in=state:12

Now that we understand the structure of the url, let's explore 2020 Response Rate data:
https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-response-rates.html

Specifically internet response rates (CRRINT) for Santa Rosa County:
https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/responserate?get=CRRINT&for=county:033&in=state:12
For all census tracts in Santa Rosa County:
https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/responserate?get=CRRINT&for=tract:*&in=county:033&in=state:12
or
https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/responserate?get=CRRINT&for=tract:*&in=state:12%20county:033

Taking this to python, for urllib we can construct the url and use urlopen() to get the response:
  
    base_url = 'https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/responserate?get='
    variable = 'CRRINT'
    geo = 'for=tract:*&in=state:12 county:033'
    url = '{}{}&{}'.format(base_url, variable, geo)
    
    response = urllib.urlopen(url)
    lines = response.readlines()

Here we start to see an advantage to requests:
  
    base_url = 'https://api.census.gov/data/2020/dec/responserate'
    data = {'get': 'CRRINT',
            'in': ['state:12', 'county:033'],
            'for': 'tract:*',
            }
    res = requests.get(base_url, data)
    res.ok  # Check that it didn't error
    result = res.content

    # You can also generally see the url string used
    res.url  

The response is a json string so you can use the json library to manipulate it:
  
    import json
    
    response_list = json.loads(result)

Or pandas dataframe
  
    import pandas
    
    df = pandas.read_json(result)
    

# Data from a map service
The original shapefile we downloaded as a .zip is also available via an API. More specifically, because it is spatial information it is available as an ArcGIS Rest Service:
https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb

Note: we can also open this in arcGIS online to see what fields we might want to query.

Each of these listings are map services, each with their own layers, e.g. Census Tracts:
https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/tigerWMS_Current/MapServer/8

Depending on the type, many of these services can be queried from the [web](https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/tigerWMS_Current/MapServer/8/query).

To return everything - Where: 1:1

Start by just returning everything in Fl:
Where: State=12

Full link:
https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/tigerWMS_Current/MapServer/8/query?where=State%3D12&text=&objectIds=&time=&geometry=&geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope&inSR=&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&relationParam=&outFields=&returnGeometry=false&returnTrueCurves=false&maxAllowableOffset=&geometryPrecision=&outSR=&returnIdsOnly=true&returnCountOnly=false&orderByFields=&groupByFieldsForStatistics=&outStatistics=&returnZ=false&returnM=false&gdbVersion=&returnDistinctValues=false&resultOffset=&resultRecordCount=&queryByDistance=&returnExtentsOnly=false&datumTransformation=&parameterValues=&rangeValues=&f=html

In Python (dropping a lot of unneeded fields):
https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/tigerWMS_Current/MapServer/8/query?where=State=12&returnGeometry=false&returnIdsOnly=true&f=html
  
    base_url = 'https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/tigerWMS_Current/MapServer/8/query'
    data = {'where': 'STATE=12',
            "returnGeometry": "false",
            "returnIdsOnly":"true",
            'f':'json'}
    
    response = requests.get(base_url, data)
    response.ok
    res = json.loads(response.content)
    res.keys()
    
Restrict it to just Santa Rosa County and return more than just the OID:
  
    data = {"where": "STATE=12 AND COUNTY=033",
            "returnGeometry": "false",
            "outFields": "STATE, COUNTY, TRACT",
            "f":"json"}

Return Geometry

    data = {"where": "STATE=12 AND COUNTY=033",
            "returnGeometry": "true",
            "returnTrueCurves": "true",
            "outFields": "STATE, COUNTY, TRACT",
            "f":"json"}
