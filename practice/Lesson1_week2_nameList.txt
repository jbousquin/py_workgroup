Often data will requiring some 'cleaning' before it can be used in analysis. This lesson will implement some of the python basics learned so far to prepare a mock dataset for further analysis.

#Script layout

All python scripts follow the same general structure when read from top to bottom:
  1. Documentation (commented text) describing what the script does who authored it
  2. import any required modules
  3. Define any functions that will be used in the script
  4. Define input variables (although this is not strict it helps to see everything at once up front)

Create a python script and add some descriptive text about what the file does using comments:

    # This file takes a string of station names and creates a noramlized list of those names for further analysis
    # Author <your name>

Next, import any modules you plan to use:

    import os
    from os.path import join

We won't use any functions yet, so the next step is to define input variables. Define the string variable you'll be working with:

    names = "Fifth Ave (boat launch),\n Little Sandy Pond,\n Skinequit Pond,\n Bearses Pond,\n Picture Lake (Flax Pond),\n Sand Pond,\n White Pond,\n Dennis Pond,\n Buck's Pond,\n Hinkley's Pond,\n Flax Pond (Yarmouth/Dennis),\n Long Pond-Long Pond Drive,\n Long Pond-Cahoon St.,\n Long Pond,\n Upper Mill Pond,\n Queen Sewell Pond,\n Crowes Pasture Beach,\n Pilgrim Lake,\n Scusset (DCR),\n Tonset,\n Herring Pond,\n Long Pond (Depot St.),\n Wiley Park,\n Minister's Pond,\n Duck Pond,\n Long Pond,\n Spectacle Pond,\n Gull Pond - Gull Pond Landing,\n Gull Pond (2) - Steele Rd.,\n Tides Hotel,\n Long Pond - Indian,\n Schoolhouse Pond,\n Princess Beach-Scargo Lake,\n Cliff Pond (DCR),\n Flax Pond (DCR),\n PARKERS RIVER SPORTFISHING PIER,\n BASS RIVER(UNC.
